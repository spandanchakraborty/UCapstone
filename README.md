# UCapstone
Capstone Project To Identify S1 and S2 Heart Sounds from Kaggle Heart_Beat_Sound Project
The Kaggle link:https://www.kaggle.com/kinguistics/heartbeat-sounds
My capstone only focuses on the 1st part of the challenge: Locating S1 and S2 heart sound in an audio file recorded from a phone app/Digital stethoscope
For this Set_A folder labeled Heart sound data is been used
The audio features are extracted using MFCC
I have done some initial analysis by using Kmeans to identify heart sounds
I am eeventually planning to neural net (CNN) to classify S1 and S2
