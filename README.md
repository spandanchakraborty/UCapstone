# UCapstone
Capstone Project To Identify S1 and S2 Heart Sounds from Kaggle Heart_Beat_Sound Project
The Kaggle link:https://www.kaggle.com/kinguistics/heartbeat-sounds

My capstone only focuses on the 1st part of the challenge: Locating S1 and S2 heart sound in an audio file recorded from a phone app/Digital stethoscope

For this Set_A folder labeled Heart sound data is been used

The audio features are extracted using MFCC/ Librosa package

My focus is to try different techniques Like Logistic Regression / SVM / Conv Nueral Net to see which one gives better results
